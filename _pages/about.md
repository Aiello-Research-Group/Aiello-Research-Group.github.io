Our research seeks to identify the interaction and influence of social and biological factors on long-term health outcomes, including the effect of socioeconomic position, stress, and infection on chronic disease and mental health outcomes. We also investigate preventive measures for reducing infectious disease transmission in the community setting with a focus on non-pharmaceutical interventions. We aim to reduce social disparities in infection, chronic disease, and mental health by conducting integrative research across areas such as sociology, epidemiology, mathematical modeling, biology, and laboratory research.
